# Advent of Code
A yearly tradition where a two-part coding problem is posted daily leading up to christmas.
Problems are available at https://adventofcode.com/.

The backstories of the problems typically tell a story of how we step-by-step help solve winter themed issues in the land of Elves, 
gradually restoring order and making all christmas related operations are functional on The North Pole.

The problems typically ramp in difficulty as the days go on.
